                <h1>The Rowing Stroke: A Story in 4 Parts</h1>
                <p>
                    The sport of rowing (sometimes called "crew") consists of an individual or a group of people who row a boat ("shell")
                    on a body of water. There are many different configurations when it comes to boats, oars, and rowers, but we're going to be
                    concerned, in this post, with the mechanics of the rowing stroke. Whether a rower is by themselves, with a team, using one oar,
                    or two, the rowing stroke is the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rowing stroke is what makes a boat go. The boats are smooth on the bottom, and aren't terribly stable. It is very important that
                    each rower work together to move the boat in the most efficient way possible. You don't want people doing their own thing, because
                    that will cause the boat to become even less stable, and the rowers will have to work harder to go the same distance. Thus, they 
                    practice moving together during the rowing stroke to ensure they are as uniform as possible to get the most efficiency from their 
                    hard work.

                    Seats in a rowing shell are mounted on a track that allows the seat to move forward and back, while a rower's feet are strapped in
                    to the boat. This allows the rower to compress and extend their legs, which moves the seat backwards and forwards.

            <section class="content">
                <h3 class="header">Part 1: The Catch</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is where each stroke begins. At this point in the process, the rower sits at full compression: 
                        their chest is compressed up against their legs, arms are fully extended, and their back is angled slightly
                        forward. It's important that the rower stay calm and stead at the catch, with weight distributed evenly over their
                        core to ensure the boat stays steady and doesn't go down to one side. The oar will be fully submerged in
                        the water, ready for the next phase of the stroke.
                    </p>
                
                <h3 class="header"h3>Part 2: The Drive</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is where the action starts: the rower explodes from the catch - from full compression of the legs and body to full extension.
                        The legs drive down while the arms stay locked in place, with the back still angled slightly forward. WIth the oar under water, this
                        has the effect of pulling the oar through the water, which in turn moves the boat. Rowers are exhaling all the air they collected 
                        during the recovery. As they approach roughly 75% leg extension, the rower will start to open up their back, and move from a forward
                        facing angle to a rear facing angle. At the same time, the arms begin to contract, and the rower brings the oar handle towards their 
                        sternum. At this point, their legs are at full extension, and we are moving to the next phase.
                    </p>
                
                <h3 class="header">Part 3: The Release</h3>
                    <p>
                        The release is where the oar is "released" from the water. The rower has the oar almost to their chest, with a few inches to between
                        the oar and the sternum. At this point, the Drive is complete, and the rower pushes down gently with their hands to release the oar
                        from the water. With the oar released, the rower moves their hands away from their body, straightens their arms, and starts a nice
                        big inhalation of air. The body angle moves from angled back, to a front facing angle. At this point, the rower has their arms
                        fully extended, body is angled forward, and their legs are still fully extended. We are now ready for the most important part of the
                        stroke.
                    </p>

                <h3 class="header"h3>Part 4: The Recovery</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Recovery is where the rower recovers from the effort of the Drive and Release, and gets into position to start it all over again. The 
                        rower, starting from their position at arms extended, body angled forward, and legs extended, starts to compress their legs. This has
                        the effect of bringing their seat "up" the track, until their legs are compressed, body is angled forward, and arms are extended. At
                        this point in the stroke, the oar is dropped into the water, and the rower finds themself at the Catch, ready to do it all again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is the most important part of the stroke in that it must be done in a controlled way to ensure the boat doesn't become unstable.
                        Failure to maintain the right speed coming up the slide will make the boat shift and possibly drop down to one side. So, the rower 
                        has to keep calm, and ensure they are concentrating on keeping steady hands and an even and controlled pace along with the rest of the
                        boat in order to keep things moving efficiently.

            <h2>Putting It All Together: Let's See a Boat Move</h2> 
                <p>
                    That is a lot of words to describe something that happens in about 3 seconds. That's right, all that effort and concentration has to
                    happen about 20 times per minute, for a slower paced practice session, and as many as 35 or 40 times per minute for elite competitors.
                    To complicate matters, this is all assuming everyone is moving together all the time (which doesn't happen often except for very well
                    trained crews). When one rower is moving out of sync, it will throw the boat down to one side, which cause other rowers to compensate, 
                    which will throw the boat off in another way. Which is to say, it's an easy thing to observe a well rowed boat, and a very tough thing 
                    to accopmlish.

                    Check out this crew (an eight man boat):

                </p>

                <p>
                    This is the Canadian Men's Eight crew rowing in a competition. They are amongst the top in the world. They will row a 2000 meter 
                    race in &lt; 5 minutes and 30 seconds. That's a pace of about 4:24/mile. And these 8 men are going through this stroke sequence
                    40 times in a minute, a little over 200 times in the race. They have to concentrate on moving <strong>together</strong> while
                    maintaining a high rate of effort. When it all comes together, it's a truly beautiful sport.
