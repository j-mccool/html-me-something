                <h1>The Rowing Stroke: A Story in 4 Parts</h1>
                <p>
                    The sport of rowing (sometimes called "crew") consists of an individual or a group of people who row a boat ("shell")
                    on a body of water. There are many different configurations when it comes to boats, oars, and rowers, but we're going to be
                    concerned, in this post, with the mechanics of the rowing stroke. Whether a rower is by themselves, with a team, using one oar,
                    or two, the rowing stroke is the same.

                    The rowing stroke is what makes a boat go. The boats are smooth on the bottom, and aren't terribly stable. It is very important that
                    each rower work together to move the boat in the most efficient way possible. You don't want people doing their own thing, because
                    that will cause the boat to become even less stable, and the rowers will have to work harder to go the same distance. Thus, they 
                    practice moving together during the rowing stroke to ensure they are as uniform as possible to get the most efficiency from their 
                    hard work.

            <h3>Part 1: The Catch</h3>
                <p>This is where each stroke begins. At this point in the process, the rower sits at full compression: 
                    their chest is compressed up against their legs, arms are fully extended, and their back is angled slightly
                    forward. It's important that the rower stay calm and stead at the catch, with weight distributed evenly over their
                     core to ensure the boat stays steady and doesn't go down to one side. The oar will be fully submerged in
                     the water, ready for the next phase of the stroke.

            <h3>Part 2: The Drive</h3>
                <p>This is where the action starts: the rower explodes from the catch - from full compression of the legs and body to full extension.
                    The legs push down while the arms stay locked in. This has the effect of pulling the oar through the water, which in turn moves
                    the boat. Rowers are exhaling all the air they collected during the recovery, and pushing their legs down for maximum effort
